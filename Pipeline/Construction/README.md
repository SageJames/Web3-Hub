## Find Hosting
This is going to need to be something that you get out of the way immediately. If you make an application that you cannot deploy, then you are going to be back at the first building block once again.**Make sure the hosting works for the application that you are building.** Having your host not work can make meeting deadlines very difficult.

## Create a roadmap
Make a timeline for building this application.
