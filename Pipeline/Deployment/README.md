# Deployment
This section shows you what you need to do to get your application on the internet and active if you desire it to be. This repository is organized to give resources you can to host and learn to deploy your website.

## Documentation

Have the repository that you created documented is very important before you host your site. If someone needs to get an idea of why you made this or why you create that before you hosted, you should give them some context within your repository.

## Community

If you are making a coin or service, then you will need a community to keep it alive. Currently there are two main ways to establish a relationship with modern cryptocurrency user-bases.
